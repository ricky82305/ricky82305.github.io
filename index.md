### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because I was very intrested in how RGB color and animation can be executed through code. To create an animated gradient in GIF format, alot of interesting elements of file manipulation, mathematical functions, and image processing take place! It's also not only a great feeling when a program runs as wanted, but to have a GIF product is an added benefit. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was also a favorite because of the differentation bewtween C++ integers, and C++ Doubles, as both have their own purposes and applications. Using decimals in C++ was unique not only beacuse of the double data type, but also beacuse of how the static cast operation is used for compilation. Overall the main challenge of this lab was in the undersdtanding of different data types like integers, doubles, or even floats, while also understanding their use with the static cast opertaion which I found very interesting.

* Lab 9

    String manipulation and comparisons are both integral concepts within C++ which is why this lab was also one of my favorites. This lab also heavily focused on bool variables and conditional statements, both of which were necesary for the specific problem that the lab focused on. Using bool variables to track whether a clash occurred and employing conditional statements to make decisions based on the comparison results were both difficult highlights of this lab.
